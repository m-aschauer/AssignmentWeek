Controller Annotation:
handles requests for web application
Spring considers it as a web controller that is capable of handling incoming HTTP requests
The @Controller annotation is usually used in combination with other annotations like
@RequestMapping, @GetMapping, @PostMapping, etc. to map requests to specific methods within the controller.
The methods within the controller handle the requests and return a response to the client
clear separation btw presentation layer and business logic layer

providing a simple and flexible way to handle incoming HTTP requests and produce appropriate responses
